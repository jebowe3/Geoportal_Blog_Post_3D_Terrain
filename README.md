# 3D Modeling with a Scanned Shaded Relief Map
Adding three dimensionality to a classic shaded relief map of Yosemite National Park

The [BTAA Geoportal](https://geo.btaa.org/) has a wealth of interesting and beautiful historic scanned maps available to the public to download. Recently, I discovered John Henry Renshawe's shaded relief maps of US national parks from the early 1900s. Using his [Panoramic View of the Yosemite National Park, California](https://geo.btaa.org/catalog/p16022coll230:2495) from 1914, I wanted to demonstrate an open-source technique for adding three dimensionality to these fantastic relief maps.
